## Summary
In the 5th gamejam of 3m5, 4 groups of 3-5 people came together to develop games around the topics shown below.
In an early meeting on Saturday, all participants had to vote democratically for 1 of 3 groups, containing 15 random words each.
There was no regulation, how many of these topics must be included in the final product.

Our team was developing a tower-defense game, with one special feature.
We intended to increase/lower the water level depending on the amount of towers.
Unfortunately this feature was given up later in the process to improve the player's overview.
